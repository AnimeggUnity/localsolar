Local Solar
Local Solar is a simple tool that estimates solar irradiance for a given location based on latitude and longitude.
The goal is to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use calculator for quickly assessing local solar energy potential.

Features
Input latitude and longitude to calculate local solar irradiance

Supports single-point estimation

Simple and intuitive workflow

Technologies
Pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript

Basic solar radiation model for calculations

(Optional) Future integration with external APIs for improved data accuracy

How to Use
Enter or select the target location (latitude and longitude).

Click "Calculate" to get the estimated solar irradiance.

Project Status
Currently in a basic version focused on simplicity.
Future plans include:

Weather data adjustments

Simulation of different panel tilt and azimuth angles

Batch query support
